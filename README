This is the final submission for the team S41. 

To compile go to Realesegcc and run 'make clean' and then 'make'.

The executable submitted to the Organizing commitee was compiled with Intel compiler icc using available profiling options and is usually faster 10-15 % than the one obtained with gcc. You can find this executable in the top directory.
